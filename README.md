# Programming Project #1: 2D rpg / Text based adventure
The player can move to locations with the ability to move backwards and fowards and random encounters may occur.
The player's goal is to get to the end to defeat the boss.
The player can gain items from killing enemies or buying them.
When The player is in combat they have the choice of Attack, Magic, Item, or Surrender (or dying).
This game will play similarly to the Oregon trail game, without the dysentery of course.
